A simple Wiki-like RESTful API, that allows you to:

- GET all articles
- POST new articles
- DELETE all articles
- GET specific articles
- PUT specific articles (replace them entirely)
- PATCH specific articles (modify them)
- DELETE specific articles

The API is not live anywhere, but if you deploy it as it is it should work fine. All you need to do is replace 'mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/wikiDB' with your own MongoDB path in the cloud.
